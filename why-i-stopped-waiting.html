      <h2>Why I Stopped Waiting to Feel Ready</h2>
      <p><em>Sometimes, the version of yourself you're waiting to become only shows up after you begin.</em></p>
      <!-- Paste your full post content here, paragraph by paragraph -->
       <h3><strong>So How Did We Get Here?</strong></h3>
       <p>It all started as most things do — with a dream and a plan. I had many dreams and even more plans on how I was going to realize those dreams. And boy, did I have plans. I was the <strong>master planner</strong>. Even my plans had <em>mini plans</em>of their own. </p>
       <p>These weren't your average, run of the mill plans either &mdash; they were elaborate, <em>motion picture, cue the credits</em> type of plans. But alas, some of the best green-lit productions neer see the light of day. That was often the fate of mine.</p>
       <p>You see, while I'm superb at making plans, let's just say my follow-through game is ... under development. After all those plans, all I had to show for it was a mild dopamine addiction and a collection of cute notebooks filled with excellent handwriting. Seriouly &mdash; I write pretty.</p>
       <p>Then one day, I sat down and began to craft my most elaborate plan yet ...</p>
       <hr/>
       <h3><strong>The Illusion of Readiness</strong></h3>
       <p>For years, I thought being prepared was the same as being ready. I told myself that once I had the perfect plan, the perfect timing, and maybe a little divine sign from the universe, I'd finally start.</p>
       <p>Oh - but not before I had <em>all</em> of the information. If there were no unknowns and every variable was thoughtfully accounted for, <strong>nothing</strong> bad could happen, right?</p>
       <p>So I planned harder. I researched deeper. I bought new notebooks &mdash; because this project deserved its own special place. After all, <em>this</em> was "the one"
       </p>
       <p>But the truth was, my dogged pursuit of perfection was standing in the way of any real progress. Somehow, I convinced myself that if I couldn't do something perfectly, it wasn't worth doing at all. Any hint of failure would cue the loud whispers of ridicule and judgement &mdash; and who wants to suffer through that?</p>
       <p>Planning became my way of feeling safe &mdash; busy enough to seem productive, structured enough to avoid the scary part: actually doing the thing.</p>
       <p>I convinced myself that readiness was a destination, something I could arrive at with enough effort. But readiness isn't a milestone. It's a mirage.</p>
       <p>Every time I said, "I'll start when ...," I pushed my dreams another inch down the road. And if I'm honest, there was comfort in that &mdash; because "someday" never asks you to risk failure.</p>
       <hr/>
       <h3><strong>The Perfect Plan</strong></h3>
       <p>Remember I said this all started with a dream ... and a plan?</p>
       <p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, I started learning about the stock market. The more I learned, the more I wanted to learn! I mean, this was great! You mean to tell me people make money by staring at red and green candles and placing bets on the future direction of stocks? <em>Sign me up!</em></p>
       <p>Eventually, I got to a place where I felt my day job was getting in the way of me making millions in the market. I spent many days thinking, <em>if only I didn't have to work this pesky job, I'd be able to focus on the becoming a market millionaire.</em></p>
       <p>So I made a plan — because that's what I do best. No was was gonna get between me and my millions!</p>
       <p>And oh, did I plan. I mapped out exactly how I would save up enough money to cover my expenses for several months (you know, just in case the market millions were running late). I rehearsed how I would break the news to my employer &mdash; who, obviously would be devastated. I even designed how I would spend my days, each starting with a vlog worthy morning routine. </p>
       <p>Only ... <strong>nothing</strong> went according to plan!</p>

       <h3><strong>Inspired Action</strong></h3>
       <blockquote>
        <p><em>Readiness doesn't arrive &mdash; it reveals itself</em></p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>When my perfect plan fell apart, something surprising happened &mdash; I didn't fall apart with it.</p>
       <p>In the quiet space between what I <em>thought</em> I wanted and what actually was, I learned abouot something called <strong>inspired action</strong> &mdash; the art of moving when your heart whistpers <em>go</em>, even if your mind still wants a full itinerary.</p>
       <p>At first, it felt reckless. For someone like me &mdash; a recovering master-planner &mdash; the idea of acting without all of the data was unthinkable. But I noticed something: every time I followed that nudge, even in small ways, life opened up a little more. My creativity returned. My curiosity bloomed. The world felt spacious again.</p>
       <p>Inspired action doesn't demand perfection; it just asks for participation. When I stopped micromanaging every detail, I started to <em>feel</em> the flow instead of forcing it. Things didn't become instantly easy, but they became <em>lighter</em>.</p>
       <p>These days, I give myself permission to learn as I go. I trade perfection for grace. I start before I feel ready &mdash; trusting that clarity comes in motion. And every time I do, I'm reminded that sometimes the best plan ... is simply to begin.</p>

       <h3><strong>Are You Inspiried Yet?</strong></h3>
       <p>Funny enough, this very blog is the product of inspired action. I didn't have a blueprint, a content calendar, or even the faintest idea what the "right" first post would be. I just felt that tug &mdash; the one that said, <em>start now, figure it out later.</em></p>
       <p>And here we are.</p>
       <p><em>Assembly Required</em> is the beginning of a new kind of building for me &mdash; one rooted in trust curiosity, and movement. I don't know exactly, where this road leads, but that's part of the adventure. My plan &mdash; if we can even call it that &mdash; is to keep following what feels aligned and share what I discover along the way.</p>
       <p>If you've ever found yourself waiting to feel ready, consider this your nudge: start assembling. Start exploring. Start becoming.</p>
       <p>I'd love for you to join me on this journey &mdash; not because I have all the answer, but because I finally stopped waiting to find them before I began.</p>
